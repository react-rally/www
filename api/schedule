      "title": "Principles of Functional Programming in React",
      "description": "As software grows, we look for new ways to break it into parts and then hook the parts together. Functional programming is about new ways to isolate and then integrate code. Learn principles behind the trappings of functional programming. React embodies some of these principles — and can embody all of them, if we use it carefully. See how we are untangling the spaghetti of MVC, first with React, then Flux, then Elm. Find out how you’re already following functional principles, and how you can choose to benefit even more.",

This fresh feature allows components to subscribe to observable data sources, and respond automatically as data is fetched or updated. The talk will cover when and how to use the new API in your own applications, and discuss how it stands to change the way we build and organize React components. We'll also detail how Parse implemented the first data source designed to interact with this API, and the lessons we learned along the way. Finally, we'll explore some unique use cases for observable data to inspire your own projects.",

Also, canvas and functional reactive programming.\n\nBasically, I will talk about how to build a simple multi-player game, which stores player state in a Flux store and syncs it across other players using sockets. Socket programming usually means event based async programming. Using streams/observables (RxJS) we can use sockets in a reactive manner, which makes it cleaner and easier to reason about.",

The tools for doing it well haven't been there.\n\nBut the tools are starting to change as the front-end is moving towards a componentized future. Frameworks like React are encouraging developers to create components that are compact and easy to reason about, as well as easy to share.\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at some of those tools, such as webpack and npm, to see how they help you work with small modules today and what's coming in the future.",

      "description": "Most people aren't aware just what an achievement CommonJS was and the true extent of its impact. It took a language that only ran in browsers, had no concept of separate files, used global variables and a single global DOM to communicate; and built something viable, then something thriving, then something dominant. All by adding only a couple of pieces of syntax and a new mental model.\n\nThere have been a lot of ideas and a lot of speculation about the future of CSS in the last year or so, largely driven by the ingenuity of the React community — will we write styling code purely in JS? Will CSS continue to be useful? Will someone concoct some X-files-style JS+CSS alien-human hybrid language that takes over the world? It's all possible (mostly).\n\nThis talk is about a new format for CSS, one that's now supported by default in Webpack & JSPM, and available with plugins for Browserify. It's called Interoperable CSS, and it hopes to do for CSS what CommonJS did for JavaScript.",

But for a highly complex visualization - and here \"visualization\" should be interpreted broadly to include all manner of charts, graphs, and dashboards with interactivity provided through scrolling, paging, filtering, focusing, and zooming - managing the state of the visualization becomes a complex task. And the problem multiplies if the data updates in real time.\n\nThis talk introduces a Flux-based strategy to separate the state of the visualization into three stores: one for the configuration of the visualization, one for the data that is the subject of visualization, and a third that bridges - and depends on - the first two and provides methods for accessing exactly the state information needed to render the current configuration of the data visualization using the subset of the current dataset that falls within the domain under inspection.",

How does it fit into Flux architechture and how can it make our apps even faster and more awesome. You'll learn what APIs the browser gives us today and how we can achieve truly offline-capable apps.
