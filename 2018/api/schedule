      "speaker": "swyx",
      "description": "Functional-reactive libraries like RxJS make it easy to understand how data changes, giving us tools to declaratively handle events and manage state. But while our render methods react to state changes, React isn’t reactive. Instead, we write imperative event-handlers, and trip up on gotchas like async setState and race conditions. Why? In this talk we build a Reactive React to show the difference between the \"push\" and \"pull\" paradigms of data flow and understand why React chooses to manage Scheduling as a core Design Principle, enabling awesome features like async rendering and Suspense!"

This talk will go over these computer science topics in the context of React Fiber, to help shed some light on how React Fiber is implemented and the control flow concepts behind the new APIs."

I will compose a musical theme for and introduce each one independently. Finally I will conduct a small chamber of orchestral musicians as they perform their themes along with an actual react component performing updates in real(ish) time!"

But COBOL never really went away -- there are COBOL programs still running our banks and civic institutions half a century after its heyday. Many JS apps will have similar lifespans, yet we struggle with the accumulated cruft of a two year-old codebase; how will we handle a hundred years? Let's examine how software can grow and adapt over the decades, so we can write code that won't be a burden to future generations."

We’ll talk about the importance and usefulness of knowing its baselines for beginners and experts alike. We'll gain a clearer understanding of where React’s magic originates. So the next time you use React or write JSX, you’ll be secretly translating in your head for deeper insight and edification."

Our components often start simple, but then they have to adapt as unforeseen use cases come up. This often results in a growing list of props and complex implementation full of if statements and a confusing API. An inevitable rewrite of the component eventually hits and now we have two problems.\n\nLet's take a step back and consider some things we can do upfront to keep our components flexible, simple, and optimized for inevitable change."
